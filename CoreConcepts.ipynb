    " * SRP – Single Responsibility Principle\n",
    "     * A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.\n",
    " * OCP – Open/Closed Principle\n",
    "     * \"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\"\n",
    " * LSP – Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "     * \"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.\" \n",
    " * ISP – Interface Segregation Principle\n",
    "     * \"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.\"[4]\n",
    " * DIP – Dependency Inversion Principle\n",
    "     * One should \"depend upon abstractions, not concretions\"\n",
