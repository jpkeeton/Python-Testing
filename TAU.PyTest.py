# Pytest is core test framework 
# let's you write test cases as functions
# executes tests and compiles pass/fail results
# similar to other test frameworks, like Python's nunit and Java's junit, Javascript's Jasmine
# But, has other cool stuff that we'll cover


# First Test

# here's a basic math operation
# def test_1Plus1():
#     assert 1 + 1 ==2


# def test_passing():
#     assert (1, 2, 3) == (1, 2, 3)

# See my Onenotes on this
# I can still run Pytest from the command line
